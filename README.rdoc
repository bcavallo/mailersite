This app will register users by name and email.  Following that anyone will be able to send such users an email through the site.  
Currently the site is not deployed.  To run locally, run bundle install and then rails server.  As it is set right now, one can 
preview emails that are sent out with the letter_opener gem rather than the emails being sent out to addresses over the internet.
